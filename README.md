<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<h3>Processing</h3>
<p>Settlement of Business Transactions and Trades</p>
<p>
  Most settlement process in the capital markets today usually take place in the standard T+2 days, these arise due to the       functional way that batching processes handle large volume. A blockchain network can be used to settle trades in a real-time   manner saving time and locked up capital. Participants would be required to create a solution to improve similar such           processing functions that exist in the Capital markets.

<ul>
  <li>Trading of security requires a lot of human involvement especially for settlements.</li>
  <li>Moreover the errors made during trade cycle is to be incurred by institutes providing trading facility , also takes days to perform settlement which requires cash and time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
<p>
  To represent intangible assets like equities/stock, etc 
into digitial assets which leads to minimal trade processing by deploying these assets on distributed ledger among participants in trade life cycle.

<p>Participants can be traders, issuers & regulatory department</p>
